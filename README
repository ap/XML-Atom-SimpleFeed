XML::Atom::SimpleFeed

This module provides a minimal API for generating Atom syndication
feeds quickly and easily. It supports all aspects of the Atom format,
but it has no provisions for generating feeds with extension elements.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Build.PL

DEPENDENCIES

You will need some kind of SAX handler to use this module.

If all you want is to output XML, that would be one of the SAX serialiser
modules. XML::SAX::Writer is recommended.
