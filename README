XML::Atom::SimpleFeed
================================

This module exists to generate basic Atom syndication feeds.  While it does 
not provide a full, object-oriented interface into all the nooks and crannies 
of Atom feeds, an Atom parser, or an Atom client API, it should be useful for 
people who want to generate valid Atom feeds of their content quickly and 
easily.

See the POD for more details.
