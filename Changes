Revision history for XML-Atom-SimpleFeed

0.8_004  2006 May 10
		- Brownbag upload: forgot to update ./Changes in 0.8_003

0.8_003  2006 May 10
		- Minor incremental progress; various bugfixes, some refactor.

0.8_002  2006 Apr 9
		- Use builtin XML writer instead of SAX for output. This eliminates
		  huge amounts of redundancy.
		- Big improvements in the distribution of responsibilities for
		  deprecation and validation checks.
		- Array-based implementation rather than inside-out objects.
		- Internal structure is now more logical and consistent.

0.8_001  2005 Sep 28
        - Emit Atom 1.0. Documentation updated to reflect Atom 1.0. Usage
          according to Atom 0.3 will transparently generate 1.0 elements but
          emit deprectation warnings.
        - Remove _generate_entry_id and use HTTP URLs as IDs by default. Using
          tag: URIs is useful for generating the ID once, up front, so that it
		  won't change even if the permalink does -- if the ID is generated
		  from the permalink, we might as well use the permalink directly.
        - Use XML::SAX::Writer instead of XML::Simple for output.

0.7  2005 May 06
        - Fix the module prereq in Makefile.PL to actually do the proper 
          dependency tests.  Oops.

0.6  2005 Apr 27
        - Use XML::Simple to generate the XML, instead of doing strings by hand.
        - Make the module more robust: it now can handle multiple titles, 
          links, etc. by passing in arrayrefs and hashrefs, while still 
          allowing for simple use with strings.
        - Many thanks to Aristotle Pagaltzis for the help.

0.5  2005 Mar 9
        - Add an as_string method to return the feed as a scalar.
        - Escape any <![CDATA[ or ]]> strings that appear in the content
          CDATA section.
        - Allow the save_file method to take either an open filehandle or 
          a scalar containing a filename.
        - These issues reported by Aristotle Pagaltzis.

0.4  2005 Feb 22
        - Rework the author code again to fixe more bugs that I probably should have
          caught before releasing 0.3.  Sigh.

0.3  2005 Feb 22
        - Fixed a bug in the entry author section where the author name was always
          showing up as "name".  CPAN RT ID# 11620
        - Fixed a similar bug in the feed-level author section.
        - Happy Birthday, Holly!

0.2  2005 Feb 19
        - Adjust the XML encoding to produce valid feeds.

0.1  2005 Feb 18
        - Initial release.
